# Programming Problem 18.8: All-Pairs Shortest Paths
#
# In this problem, each file describes a directed graph. The first line of the file indicates the number
# of vertices and edges, respectively. Each subsequent line describes an edge (the first two numbers are its tail
# and head, respectively) and its length (the third number). NOTE: edge lengths might be negative, and the graphs
# may or may not be negative cycles.
#
# Test cases: (contributed by Matt Davis) What is the shortest shortest path in the graphs described in this file
# and in this file? (I.e., the minimum, over choices of an origin s and a destination t, of a shortest s-t path in the graph.)
# (If the graph has a negative cycle, your algorithm should detect that fact.) (Answer: -2 and "contains a negative cycle," respectively.)
#
# Challenge data set: Repeat the previous problem for the graphs described in the following files: graph #1, graph #2, graph #3, and graph #4.
