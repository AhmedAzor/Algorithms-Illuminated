#
# In this problem, each file describes the weights of vertices in a path graph and has the format:
# [number_of_vertices_in_path_graph]
# [weight of first vertex]
# [weight of second vertex]
# ...
# Test case: (contributed by Logan Travis) What is the value of a maximum-weight independent set of the 10-vertex path graph described in this file, and which vertices belong to the MWIS? (Answer: 2617, and the vertices 2, 4, 7, and 10).
# Challenge data set: Repeat the previous problem for the 1000-vertex path graph described in this file.
